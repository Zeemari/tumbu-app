# Timbu Shopping App

Welcome to the Timbu Shopping App, a React Native application with a user-friendly interface inspired by a Figma UI design. The app features a home page with a slider showcasing various items and special offers, as well as highlighted products. Despite the challenges, I have worked hard to implement few of  the requirements and i will continue to strive for improvement in mobile development.
